# Tab Stopper

Tab Stopper lets you turn multiple cursors and selections into tab stops. When you run the command `Tab Stopper: Cursors to Tab Stops` (Default shortcut: `ctrl+alt+T`) it replaces your selections with a snippet, placing a tab stop at each cursor so you can perform edits on each selection one at a time.
